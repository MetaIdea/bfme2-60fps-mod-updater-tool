# bfme2-60fps-mod-updater-tool
A automation tool chain to update any BFME2 and ROTWK mod to 60 fps with proper gamespeed.

Usage:
- Copy the mod big file(s) into the MOD-BIG-FILES folder
- Start UpdateMod.bat
- 60 fps updated mod version gets created in the UPDATED-MOD folder

How does this work:
- It enables 60 fps
- The important part: It replaces all time, rate and speed related values with ones recduced by 50%. The values get calculated during the run of the tool so it can work with any mod.

Note: This repo won't get any more updates since a new project with a engine altering approach is on the horizon: https://github.com/MetaIdea/SageMetaTool
